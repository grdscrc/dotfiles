The `Time::Local` module is primarily used for converting dates and times to and from epoch time (seconds since the epoch) using functions like `timelocal` and `timegm`.\n\nIf you need to format time using `strftime`, you can use the `POSIX` module or the `Time::Piece` module as mentioned in the previous response. These modules provide the `strftime` function for formatting time strings in various formats.\n\nHere's an example using the `POSIX` module to format time with `strftime`:\n\n```perl\nuse POSIX qw(strftime);\n\nmy $timestamp = time();  # Get the current timestamp\nmy $formatted_time = strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\", localtime($timestamp));\n\nprint \"Formatted Time: $formatted_time\\n\";\n```\n\nIf you specifically need to use `strftime` from `Time::Local`, you can combine it with `localtime` or `gmtime` to get the time components and then format them manually.

You can use this property to check if the array has elements.\n\n```perl\nmy @array = (1, 2, 3);\n\nif (@array) {\n    print \"Array has one or more elements\\n\";\n} else {\n    print \"Array is empty\\n\";\n}\n```\n\nBoth of these methods will allow you to determine if an array has one or more elements."
